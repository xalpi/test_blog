title: "Benchmarking Classic Algorithms"

In this short post, we compare several classic sorting algorithms on modern hardware and inputs.

## Why this matters

Even simple algorithm choices can impact performance in production systems â€” especially with edge cases or large-scale inputs.

## What we tested

We benchmarked:
- QuickSort
- MergeSort
- HeapSort
- TimSort (Python built-in)

Results will follow in future posts, but the takeaway so far is: context matters more than asymptotic complexity.

Stay tuned!
